A key-value database which I am developing(recently postponed since I am too busy with graduation thesis =,=, but I promise I will return!), it will support the 6 data structures supported by redis, but instead using multi-thread infrastructure, we will assimilate the design patterns from memcached, muduo....to build our own k-v database.

This note will be kept in updating;

A key-value database which me and Akuan(https://github.com/Akuan1994) are developing, it will support the 6 data structures supported by redis, but instead using multi-thread infrastructure, we will assimilate the design patterns from memcached, muduo....to build our own k-v database.

This note will be kept in updating;
